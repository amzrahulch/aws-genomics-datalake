Even as data is exploding from various population genomics projects all over the world, researchers in the field find it hard to perform large scale genomics analyses with data scattered across multiple data silos within their organizations. In order to be able to perform more sophisticated tertiary analysis on genomics and clinical data, researchers need to be able to access, aggregate and query the data from a centralized data store in a secure and compliant manner. 

In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to transform genomic variant data using Amazon EMR to populate a genomics data lake that can then be queried using Amazon Athena. We use Hail (https://hail.is/) a genomics software tool from the Broad Institute, on Amazon EMR to perform the data transformation. We will also demonstrate optimizations that improve query performance, and will use the 1000 genomes data available on the AWS Registry of Open data as an example dataset.
